        <p>
            Countries worldwide are adopting stronger forest protection laws and launching reforestation missions.
            <strong>UN initiatives such as REDD+</strong> reward nations for reducing deforestation, while
            the <strong>Paris Agreement</strong> encourages expansion of forest cover to absorb carbon and restore ecosystem integrity.

        <p>
            Technology is revolutionizing conservation efforts. Drones help detect illegal logging, satellite imagery tracks biodiversity,
            and AI predicts ecosystem threats. Smart irrigation systems, soil restoration technologies, and data-driven monitoring tools
            are accelerating global forest recovery efforts.

        <p>
            NGOs, students, and community groups are driving positive change through plantation drives, river cleanups,
            and sustainability awareness workshops. Indigenous communitieswho safeguard nearly <strong>one-third of the worlds forests</strong>
            are gaining recognition and support for their sustainable land management practices.
