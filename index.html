    <h2>Why SDG 15 Matters</h2>
    <p>
        SDG 15 focuses on conserving forests, combating land degradation, and protecting biodiversity. 
        Forests are not just collections of trees; they are the lungs of the Earth and home to nearly 80% of terrestrial species.
        Today, deforestation continues at an alarming rate due to agriculture, urban expansion, and illegal logging.

    <p>
        <strong>Over 10 million hectares of forest are lost every year.</strong> This drastically affects rainfall patterns, increases carbon emissions,
        disrupts ecosystems, and accelerates climate change. Forest conservation is no longer optional; it is an emergency priority
        for all nations.
    </p>

    <p>
        The mission of SDG 15 is to restore degraded land, conserve endangered species, strengthen forest governance,
        and promote sustainable ecosystem-based solutions for future generations.
